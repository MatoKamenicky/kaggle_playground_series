# Kaggle Playground Series Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for various Kaggle Playground Series competitions.  
Each competition I participate in has its own dedicated folder with the code, notebooks, and everything what is 
necessary for the competition.

## 📌 Overview
The Kaggle Playground Series offers beginner-friendly machine learning competitions with synthetic or adapted datasets.  
Here I explore different models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation strategies.
