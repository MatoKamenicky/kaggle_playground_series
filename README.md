# Kaggle Playground Series Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for various Kaggle Playground Series competitions.  
Each competition I participate in has its own dedicated folder with the code, notebooks, and everything what is 
necessary for the competition.

## 📌 Overview
The Kaggle Playground Series offers beginner-friendly machine learning competitions with synthetic or adapted datasets.  
Here I explore different models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation strategies.

## 🏆 Competitions Participated
- **[S5E7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7)** — Predicting if a person is introverted or extroverted  
- **[S5E8](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8)** — Predicting whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit

*(This list will be updated as I join new competitions.)*

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of the desired competition.
2. Open the notebook to review preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
3. Use the generated `submission.csv` to submit to Kaggle.
